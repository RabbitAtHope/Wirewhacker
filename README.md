////

  A lightweight and simple Wi-Fi scanner and cracker for Windows, using netsh and Python. Can feed in custom passwords.

  The vast majority of WiFi cracking tools (i.e. aircrack) only work on Linux, due to the tighter restrictions Windows places on wireless connections and packet sniffing. As such, I wanted to provide a simple, albeit slower tool that can be used on a Windows machine if you don't have a Linux machine on hand.

  <i>Do not use this tool on networks you don't have permission to crack. I am not responsible for any damage caused by this tool.</i>
